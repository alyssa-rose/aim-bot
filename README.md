# aim-bot

## Introduction
The aim-bot library is aimed (lol) at using computer vision to track and shoot circles in AimLab in real time. 

## Project Components
The project consists of subcomponents: OpenCV to run the computer vision, a camera to point at the screen to capture the circles (this was chosen instead of using 
screen record to save computational resources and prevent any issues with anti-cheat software), a series of motors and 3d printed parts to move and click the mouse, 
and finally access to AimLab to test it all!
